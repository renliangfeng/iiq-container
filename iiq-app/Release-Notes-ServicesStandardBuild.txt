IMPORTANT: Ant is no longer provided with the SSB and must be supplied by the implementer.

- Latest version of Ant should be downloaded and made available in the path for execution 
	For Unix & Mac systems: 
		export ANT_HOME=<Location of ant> (eg: $HOME/build_tools/apache-ant-1.10.9)
		export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin

	For Windows Machines (SET is for current process space, to set the variables globally use syntax for SETX or use UI to set the variables)
		SET ANT_HOME=<Location of ant> (eg: D:\build_tools\apache-ant-1.10.9)
		SET PATH=%ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
	
- If variables cannot be set, update the following lines
	build.sh (for unix machines) - ant $@  to <ANT_HOME>/bin/ant $@ (e.g.: $HOME/build_tools/apache-ant-1.10.9/bin/ant $@)
	build.bat (for windows machines) - ant %* to <ANT_HOME>\bin\ant %* (e.g.:  D:\build_tools\apache-ant-1.10.9\bin\ant %*)


The following SSB components have been removed:

- SSB Build Checks (will be replaced with a PS Extension plugin)
- SSB Document Generator / 'document' Ant target (new documentation tools are planned
  as PS Extensions)

JDK version 7 is no longer supported in the SSB/SSD.

To assist the SailPoint Support team, the version of the SSB or SSD used to build 
IdentityIQ can now be seen by accessing the ServicesStandardVersion.html file at the root
of the application (e.g. http://servername:8080/ServicesStandardVersion.html).  This
information is taken from these release notes, so please do not delete this file or move
it from its current location, and do not delete the html file that is generated during the
build process.  The page also includes a timestamp indicating the last time the build was
executed.


The SSB is part of the Services Standard Deployment (SSD).  For more details please visit:
